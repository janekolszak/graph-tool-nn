Graph Tool Neural Networks
==========================
**Graph-tool Neural Networks** is an implementation of ANN on top of `graph-tool 
<http://graph-tool.skewed.de/>`_. It makes researching neural networks nice&easy 
- one can create custom nets and train them with various algorithms. 
Connections in the network are stored as a *graph_tool.Graph* object so it's 
convenient to analyze, plot them and do a lot of the stuff you'd normally do with a graph.
