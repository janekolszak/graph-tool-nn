Graph-tool Neural Networks
====

Graph-tool is a great open source tool for creating, using and analyzing graphs. It's a python
library with C++ bindings, uses boost::graph under the hood and seems to be pretty fast
(http://graph-tool.skewed.de/).

Graph-tool Neural Networks (gtnn) is an implementation of ANN on top of graph-tool. It makes
researching neural networks nice&easy. You can create custom nets, train, analyze and plot them.


### Status
GTNN is still under heavy development in pre-alpha stage... yeah unfinished.:)
